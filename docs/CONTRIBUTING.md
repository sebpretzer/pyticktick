## Contributing to the Documentation

In order to contribute to the documentation, please go through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sebpretzer/pyticktick/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adocumentation) to find an issue that you can work on. If you don't find an issue, you can [create a new one](https://github.com/sebpretzer/pyticktick/issues/new?template=documentation.yaml).

Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. When you have the forked repository on your workspace, you can [set up your local environment](guides/development/setup_local_environment.md) and [run the documentation server locally](guides/development/running_the_documentation_server_locally.md).

This documentation attempts to follow the approach of [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/). Please ensure that you bucket your changes into the appropriate section of the documentation, depending on the question you are answering. You may find that your documentation changes can be split into multiple buckets.

When you are ready to submit your changes, you can [open a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request).

## Contributing to the Codebase

In order to contribute to the codebase, please go through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sebpretzer/pyticktick/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen+label%3Abug%2Cenhancement) to find an issue that you can work on. If you don't find an issue, you can [create a bug report](https://github.com/sebpretzer/pyticktick/issues/new?template=bug.yaml) or [feature request](https://github.com/sebpretzer/pyticktick/issues/new?template=feature.yaml).

Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. When you have the forked repository on your workspace, you can [set up your local environment](guides/development/setup_local_environment.md). You should try your best to follow the [codebase conventions](explanations/code_conventions.md) when making your changes. Once you are done editing, it's time to [test your changes locally](guides/development/running_tests_locally.md).

Once all tests pass on your machine, you can [open a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request).
