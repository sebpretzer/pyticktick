# Client (V1)

This reference documentation provides a comprehensive overview of all V1 endpoint
methods available in the client. To see the V2 methods, please refer to the
[_Client (V2)_ reference docs](v2.md).

!!! note
    This attempts to follow the [TickTick API Reference](https://developer.ticktick.com/docs/index.html#/openapi?id=api-reference) as closely as possible. If functionality is missing, but you expect it to be there, it may be supported in the V2 client functions.
